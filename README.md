# CS501
I'm creating this as a place to store and showcase my final project for CS501 Introduction to Programming. 
For this project I decided to create a program that would allow my parents to search their massive classical music 
CD and sheet music collection by composer, genre, and song name. For this project I simplified one of the excel spreadsheets
into CSV file with a smaller amount of variables. Some qualifications for this project included the use 
of class hierarchy, loops, and I/O exceptions. Thanks for checking out on of my first programming projects!
